What is Actuator?
Actuator is like a dashboard for your Spring Boot application.
It gives you ready-to-use endpoints to check health, monitor performance,
and manage your app without writing extra code.

With Actuator you can:
- Check if the app is UP or DOWN
- Monitor memory, CPU, and threads
- View logs and metrics
- Track HTTP requests
- Integrate with monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana, etc.)

2. How to Add Actuator
Add this dependency in pom.xml:
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
Restart your app, and Actuator will be enabled.

3. Default Endpoints
Base URL: http://localhost:8080/actuator
Some common endpoints:
- /health       -> Shows app health status
- /info         -> Shows app details (version, name)
- /metrics      -> Performance metrics
- /env          -> Environment variables and configs
- /loggers      -> Logging levels
- /threaddump   -> Active threads info

4. Health Check
Open: http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
Response:
{
  "status": "UP"
}

5. Metrics
Open: http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics

6. Security
By default, only /health and /info are public.
Other endpoints should be secured.

To expose all endpoints (for development):

application.properties:
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
management.endpoint.health.show-details=always

7. Summary
- Add dependency spring-boot-starter-actuator
- Explore endpoints at /actuator
- Use /health, /info, /metrics frequently
- Secure endpoints for production
- Integrate with monitoring tools for dashboards
