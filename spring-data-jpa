Furthermore, we can create our spring boot project in 3 different ways. These are the 3 common ways: 
- Using Spring Initialzr, the user's way of creating a spring boot project from a simple user interface.
- Using Spring Boot CLI, we can create a spring boot project using it's command line interface. 
- By creating a simple maven project and adding the spring dependencies later to pom.xml file. 

We can change the port of listening our application in the application's properties file called 'application.properties' using 'server.port = port number'. 

Spring Data JPA : The Data Tier (connecting to the database) 

JPA or Java Persistence API is a specification that lets you do ORM or Object Relational mapping. A database is mostly relational and is handled by writing SQL. Now, JPA maps the classes and it's objects in Java to the SQL tables in the database. 

Spring data JPA is a separate project that lets you connect to a relational database and let you provide this JPA config on your entity classes and then handles most of the process.
